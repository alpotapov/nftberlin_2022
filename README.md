## Telemedicine x web3

### User Stories (hackathon goals)

Patient schedules a telemedicine appointment with the doctor.

Patient shares medical history items with the doctor in advance.

Doctor and Patient have an appointment via a live video chat.

Doctor writes down the outcomes of an appointment (prescription, diagnosis etc).

Appointment outcomes (video chat recording and text data) are stored on Arweave.

Patient has access to all appointment outcomes.

### User Stories (plans for the future)

Patient gives a positive review to the doctor.

Patient gives a negative review to the doctor and the case is sent to the arbitrage.

A doctor from the community is randomly (?) selected and given access to the appointment outcome data.

Randomly selected doctor reviews the case and gives his judgement.
